Project Requirements: Sign-Up Application

We are developing a user registration application to store user names and ages. 
We will use a struct to represent each user, stored in an array (limited to 100 records).
Users can add records and retrieve them by ID.

Steps to Complete:
1-Include necessary headers.
2-Define a struct for user records (Person), and declare an array of this type (Person records[100]).
3-Implement functions:
 A-void AddRecord(const std::string& name, int age): Adds a new record.
 B-FetchRecord(int id): Retrieves a record by ID.
 C-Quit().
4-In main(), use a loop to present options (Add Record, Fetch Record, Quit).
Handle user input using a switch statement:
Case 1: Prompt for name and age, then call AddRecord().
Case 2: Prompt for ID, then call FetchRecord() and display the result.
Case 3: Exit the loop.
